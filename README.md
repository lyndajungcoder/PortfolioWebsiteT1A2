## Purpose of the Website

The goal of this website is to present myself as a Web Developer. The interface is intricately engineered to ensure smooth and rapid navigation for clients exploring multiple portfolios. Its core aim is to engage the client's interest within a few mouse clicks.
Additionally, it aims to display all projects with an attractive design. It aims to show my personality and who I am in just a few clicks.

## Functionality / Features

#### Features of the website
* Easy Navigation
* Simple Design
* Engaging Design
* Creative Content
* Interactive and Responsive design

#### Features & Functions
* I designed a primary icon that now serves as the main logo on the Navigation Bar and browser tabs. It has a hover over effect which creates an interactive experience with the end user. It also serves as a function as it will take the user to the "Home" page regardless of what page they are on.

* Achieving interactive design involves implementing scroll reveal effects and hover-on effects. These effects are consistently applied throughout the entire website to maintain a cohesive look and feel.

* All the buttons on the website have been designed to be interactive by using a hover-over effect. 

* When the screen size decreases, the navigation bar will transition into a hamburger menu bar.

* All pages have a side icon that directs the end user to my Github and Linkedin site.

* The main page features a quick access button to my portfolio and a "Hire Me" button.

* The website aims to allow the end user to easily click on a communication method as soon as they decide they would like to engage further with me.
